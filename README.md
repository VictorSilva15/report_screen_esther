Hello, Here you will find a simple page built in React Native using Expo Framework. The page was published in expo. If you want access, click [here](https://expo.dev/@victorhugo_16/esther_report?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go) and you'll see a QR and a link which you can use to open in your smartphone using `Expo Go` application that can be installed in you Android/ios device.

finished... 🚀

## Requirements and How to use

To run this application locally you just need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your computer. By doing that npm (node package manager) will be installed too. So know you can start the application by running:


```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start

```

If you prefer you can run by using `yarn` instead:

```bash
# Install yarn in computer globally
npm install yarn --global

# Install all dependencies with yarn
yarn

# Start the application with yarn
yarn start

```

> If you have some trouble, try to isntall expo-cli globally in you machine by doing:

```bash
# npm
npm install -g expo-cli
# yarn
yarn add global expo-cli
```
